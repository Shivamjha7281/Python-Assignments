        "\n",
        "(ii) Saves computer resources: Good memory management saves the computer's memory (RAM) from getting wasted. When your program no longer needs any data, Python frees up that memory so that it can be used by some other program or some other part of your program. This is similar to renting out a vacant house so that it does not lie idle.\n",
        "\n",
        "(iii) Memory-Related Errors se Bachav: Agar memory ko theek se manage na kiya jaaye toh \"memory leak\" jaisi problems aa sakti hain, jahan program dhire-dhire saari memory kha jaata hai aur crash ho jaata hai. Automatic memory management in errors se bachata hai. Yeh waisa hai jaise agar Patna ke nalon ki safai theek se ho toh woh block nahi honge aur paani jama nahi hoga.\n",

This allows developers to focus on the logic and functionality of the program, rather than the details of memory management. It is like if you know the recipe for making rasgulla, you focus only on it, not thinking about where the ingredients come from and how to store them (someone else is looking after that work)."
